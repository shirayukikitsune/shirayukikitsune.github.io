Hello, everyone!

Even more progress with the [_XBeat_][1] game! 

Finally fixed <strike>- for real -</strike> the bone deformation. Thanks [MMDAgent][2], got the code from you! :D

#### Edit: 

Not really fixed, when I tested with other bones, it didn't work properly. If you note the second screenshot, the elbow does not look correct.
